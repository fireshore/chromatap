Thanks for checking out my demo project for Unity3D.

Here's a gameplay video of the project:

Chromatap is a reaction game designed for mobile.
In the center of the screen, there's a grey circle.
When the player holds down their finger on the screen,
a smaller, colored circle will expand from the center
and out.

The goal is to expand the smaller circle as close to
the grey boundary as possible, but not beyond.

The player has to stay on their toes, however, as
sometimes red circles will appear, that cannot be
touched -- the player must instead wait for these to
disappear.

The player has to expand the circle within a time limit,
with increasing difficulty in both time and accuracy.

Streaks of high-scoring taps will award a Heart,
that will save you once, if you make a mistake.

Should you fail, you can chose to 'revive', and continue
gameplay from the score you failed at, by watching
a rewarded video ad (works only on mobile).

The game also works on PC; use the Space key to
expand the circle.
